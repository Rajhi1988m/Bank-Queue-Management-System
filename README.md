# Bank-Queue-Management-System

The fundamental goal of our project was to build an online bank management system that automates all the banking processes, thus providing a user-friendly interface for clients. 
By automating the bank process, any information related to the user can be searched easily as well as it can help maintain data effectively and efficiently. 
In our banking system, four main features are displayed on our menu screen. They are: open a new customer account, view details of an account by logging in to
the system (with a username and a password), ask for assistance, and logout of the system. 
In addition, it only allows authorized clients to access different functions/processes that are available within the system as our system is password protected to lessen security fraud. 
Furthermore, users can manage all bank account activities by selecting one of the following options:

•	User menu options
•	Create an account
•	View current account balance
•	Search a particular account holder details
•	Delete an account
•	Add funds to an account
•	Withdraw funds from an account
•	Ministatement of all transactions made on an account
•	Transfer funds from one account to another account
•	Put funds as a fixed deposit on an account (along with the interest rate of 6%, 8%, and 10%)
•	View a fixed deposit on an account
•	View transactions made by the user
•	Update an account by providing new information

Clients can also manage the following account types: savings account, current account, fixed deposit account, and other account. 
The project considered all the above-mentioned features to meet the requirements of an arbitrary bank. Please refer to the bank queues system zip folder 
to access the specification and implementation files. To demonstrate all the above features, screenshots of the program output are displayed on the next page, step-by-step along with the guidelines.
